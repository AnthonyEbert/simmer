Please find below a short explanation of the most important terminologies used in the docs.

* __Arrivals__  
   An arrival is created by a generator. An arrival can be considered a active process which has a number of activities associated to it. These activities conform to a trajectory specification.
   
* __Activity__ 
   Currently, the available activities consist of `seize`, `release`, `timeout`, `rollback` and `branch`. See their respective documentation for details.

* __Trajectories__
   When a generator creates an arrival is couples the arrival to a trajectory. A trajectory can be defined as a interlinkage of activities which together form the trajectory. Once an arrival is coupled to the trajectory it will (in general) start processing the activities in the trajectory in the specified order.

* __Generators__  
   A generator is a process  which creates arrivals with a given interval. These arrivals follow a specified trajectory.

* __Resource__
   A resource is in essence a passive process. It has a specified capacity and can be seized and released by an active process.


* __Queue__
   A resource as an associated queue. If a resource is _busy_ requests for it will be added to the queue. The queue length can be specified in `add_resource`.


### Bringing it together

```{r}
library(simmer)

# create a trajectory "my_trajectory"
# this trajectory consists of 3 activities, a seize, timeout and release activity.
t0<-
  create_trajectory("my_trajectory") %>%
  seize("operator", 1) %>%
  timeout(function() rpois(1,50)) %>%
  release("operator", 1)

env<-simmer() %>%
  # a resource operator is created with a capacity of 1
  add_resource("operator", 1) %>%
  # a generator which will create arrivals with interval rpois(1,40) is added,
  # the arrivals will follow the trajectory specified in t0
  add_generator("my_generator", 
                trajectory = t0,
                dist = function() rpois(1, 40)) %>%
  run()
