Please find below a short explanation of the most important terminologies used in the docs.

* __Arrivals__  
   An arrival is created by a generator. An arrival can be considered a process which follows a number of activities specified in a trajectory.
   
* __Activity__ 

* __Trajectories__
   When a generator creates an arrival is couples the arrival to a trajectory. A trajectory can be defined as a interlinkage of activities which together form the trajectory. The arrival couples to the trajectory will (in general) start processing the activities in the trajectory in the specified order.

* __Generators__  
   A generator is a process  which creates arrivals with a given interval. These arrivals follow a specified trajectory.

* __Resource__

* __Queue__


### Bringing it together

```{r}
library(simmer)

# create a trajectory "my_trajectory"
# this trajectory consists of 3 activities, a seize, timeout and release activity.
t0<-
  create_trajectory("my_trajectory") %>%
  seize("operator", 1) %>%
  timeout(rpois(1,50)) %>%
  release("operator", 1)

env<-simmer() %>%
  # a resource operator is created with a capacity of 1
  add_resource("operator", 1) %>%
  # a generator which will create arrivals with interval rpois(1,40) is added,
  # the arrivals will follow the trajectory specified in t0
  add_generator("my_generator", 
                trajectory = t0,
                dist = function() rpois(1, 40)) %>%
  run()
  



```
