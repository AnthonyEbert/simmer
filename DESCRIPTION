Description: A process-oriented and trajectory-based Discrete-Event Simulation
    (DES) package for R. It is designed as a generic yet powerful framework. The
    architecture encloses a robust and fast simulation core written in 'C++' with
    automatic monitoring capabilities. It provides a rich and flexible R API that
    revolves around the concept of trajectory, a common path in the simulation
    model for entities of the same type.
